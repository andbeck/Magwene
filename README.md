# Magwene Function Conditional Independence Graphs

This is the Magwene (2001) conditional independence calcs and plotting

Two main files are provided.  

One is the magwene.inversion() function which takes a data frame, covariance matrix or correlation matrix, passes a correlation matrix onwards and generates partial correlation, edge exclusion deviance, tests and ultimately a graph/network visualisation using the package igraph.

The second is an application of the function to the data in Magwene 2001 (The Fowl dataset), reproducing his matrices and graph.

Data from Mikolajewski et al 2015 (JEB) and a partial script for that are provided as well.

## Help file for using the function
To Be Prepared (Script is Annotated).
